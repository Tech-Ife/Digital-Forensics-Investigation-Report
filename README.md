# Digital Forensics Investigation: The Stolen Szechuan Sauce

##  Project Overview

This project formed part of my training during the February 2025 cohort at the Lighthouse Labs Cybersecurity Bootcamp. It contains a **comprehensive Digital Forensics Report and investigation findings** for the **simulated incident “The Stolen Szechuan Sauce.”**  

 As part of the project, I was provided with a set of forensic artifacts, including disk images, memory dumps, and network traffic logs (PCAP), and tasked with conducting a comprehensive digital forensics investigation. 
 
This hands-on simulation offered valuable insights into **malware behavior, attack vectors, persistence mechanisms, and lateral movement techniques**, all derived from analyzing digital evidence such as **disk images, memory dumps, and network packet captures (PCAPs)**.

##  Executive Summary

In this project, a malicious actor infiltrated a victim network using **RDP brute force** to compromise a Windows Server and Desktop. A malware payload named `coreupdater.exe` was discovered, which connected to known malicious infrastructure to exfiltrate data.

This investigation successfully reconstructed the sequence of the attack, identified affected systems, examined evidence of lateral movement, and validated the breach through digital artifacts. The report concludes with actionable recommendations aligned with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** and **NIST SP 800-53**.

##  Methodology

The forensic workflow followed these stages:

1. **Image Analysis**: Inspected disk and memory images using FTKImager and Autopsy.
2. **Network Forensics**: Analyzed PCAP traffic with Wireshark.
3. **Malware Identification**: Verified malicious binaries via hash comparison and VirusTotal.
4. **Timeline Reconstruction**: Correlated timestamps from artifacts and logs.
5. **Threat Intelligence**: Used MITRE ATT&CK, AlienVault OTX, and VirusTotal intelligence.
6. **Reporting**: Compiled findings with recommendations.
